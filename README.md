# Enhancing-Breast-Cancer-Prediction-through-SVM-based-Analysis
Breast cancer is a significant global health concern among women and ranks as one of the leading causes of concern in healthcare.In recent years, it has become increasingly common to use machine learning techniques for breast cancer prognosis and predicting the likelihood of breast cancer.To enhance the predictive power of our SVM-based breast cancer prediction model, we employed a technique called Grid Search.Our findings indicate that the proposed SVM model with Grid Search achieves an accuracy rate of 96%, demonstrating its potential as a clinical tool for breast cancer prediction.
